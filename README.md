# Loan Status Prediction using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting loan approval status using logistic regression. Logistic regression is a common machine learning technique used for binary classification tasks like loan approval prediction. This project aims to help lenders assess the likelihood of approving a loan application based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the "data" directory. It includes the following files:

loan_data.csv: This CSV file contains historical loan application data, including features such as applicant's income, credit score, loan amount, employment status, and the loan status (1 for approved, 0 for not approved).
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-Python 3.x installed
-Required libraries and packages (See requirements.txt)
## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```R

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Start by cloning this repository:
```R

git clone https://github.com/Luvi64bit/Loan-Status-Prediction.git

cd Loan-Status-Prediction
```

Place your own dataset in the "data" directory or use the provided loan_data.csv.

Run the Jupyter Notebook Loan_Status_Prediction.ipynb to train and evaluate the logistic regression model.

You can also use the trained model for predictions by calling the appropriate functions or endpoints, depending on your application.

## Model Training
The Jupyter Notebook Loan_Status_Prediction.ipynb walks you through the process of:

-Data preprocessing
-Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-Feature selection
-Model training and evaluation
-Hyperparameter tuning (if necessary)
## Results
The project's success and performance metrics are detailed in the notebook. Make sure to review these metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
